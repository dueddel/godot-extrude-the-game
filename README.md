# Extrude – The Game (Prototype)

A simple game based on extrusion mechanics. (For now it's only based on the _idea_ of extrusion since currently only a simple line is drawn instead of rotating and extruding a mesh's faces.)

The game was made in the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/). It has been inspired by the Blender game "Extrude" as presented in one of [Imphenzia's](https://www.imphenzia.com/) "10 minute modeling challenge" [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Imphenzia/videos).

See [&rarr; Let's model a HOT-AIR BALLOON in (kind of) 10 MINUTES - ep. 67 - Blender 2.92](https://youtu.be/OC1dkozagTs) for more information.

See also the links in the video's description where you'll find the original Extrude .blend file which has been provided by Imphenzia: [&rarr; "Extrude Level 67"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2nco0rb3a9g4x4o/ExtrudeLevel67.zip?dl=0)  
In this project you'll only find an export of that .blend file in glTF format in case you're asking…

However, let's get down to business – or playing.

## How to play

![Steering wheel icon](./steering-wheel-small.png)  
**Enter an angle** in degrees to turn the steering wheel and **hit the Enter key**.

Then **enter a distance** to define how far to "drive" and again **hit the Enter key**.

Well, that's basically the whole game.

## Roadmap (pun intended)

This is a prototype and intentionally incomplete. There are a few missing features such as:

* extrusion of an actual mesh (instead of that thin drawn line)
* collision detection with walls
* a timer counting up
* some sorta highscore listing

Currently I can't guarantee to ever finish this game since it was just a side project for playing around with the Godot game engine.
